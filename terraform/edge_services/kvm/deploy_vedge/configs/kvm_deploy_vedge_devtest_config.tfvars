# KVM Deploy vEdge Configuration - Devtest mode (Internal Use Only)
#
# Devtest differs from production in three ways:
#   - cloud-init creates an SSH user
#   - cloud-init carries the onboarding endpoints, if you set them
#   - a kernel-managed mgmt NIC is attached, so the interface order gains a
#     leading `mgmt` and NIC 0 is no longer the first ISP WAN
#
# It requires a devtest GNOS image; the image decides which build boots, not
# this setting. See the KVM section of terraform/README.md for prerequisites.
